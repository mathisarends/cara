# Cara

Wake-word driven local voice loop:

1. listens for the wake word
2. records one microphone utterance until silence
3. sends the WAV to OpenAI speech-to-text
4. sends the transcript to the OpenAI Responses API
5. synthesizes the answer as WAV and plays it locally

## Run

Set `OPENAI_API_KEY`, connect a microphone and speakers, then run:

```powershell
uv run python main.py
```

The default wake word is `hey_mycroft`. Runtime recordings and TTS files are written below the system temp directory in `cara`.
While Cara is responding, say the wake word again to interrupt the response and start a new turn.

## Device discovery

Helper scripts under `scripts/` find the local devices Cara talks to and print the environment variables to add to your `.env`:

```bash
# Sonos speakers -> SONOS_IP_ADDRESS (skips the runtime network scan)
bash scripts/discover_sonos.sh

# Philips Hue bridge -> HUE_BRIDGE_IP and HUE_APP_KEY
# (press the bridge's link button when prompted)
bash scripts/discover_hue.sh
```

Sonos discovery needs the optional `sonos` dependency; the script runs it via `uv run --extra sonos`.
